## Introduction

This project aims to develop a classification model that can aid in the early detection of ASD by analyzing feedback. We implemented different machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes, to accurately identify signs of ASD. Additionally, we created a research paper that details the construction of the project, our findings, and the potential impact on early ASD detection.

## Features

- **Classification Model**: A machine learning model for detecting ASD based on feedback data.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implemented KNN and Naive Bayes classification algorithms.
- **Research Paper**: A comprehensive document explaining the project, discoveries, and implications for early ASD detection.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
